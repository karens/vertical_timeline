# Vertical Timeline

Drupal 8 Views style plugin to create a vertical timeline display.

Code based on http://codepen.io/codyhouse/full/FdkEf with some refinements from https://github.com/jasperck/vertical-timeline.

To use, create a new view using the Vertical Timeline style. Include a date field to label the timeline node but exclude it from the view.
Set up all other fields formatted and ordered as desired to display them in the timeline entry. Example view included.

Lots of things could be done to jazz this up. Currently the timeline icons are just randomly assigned, for instance.
